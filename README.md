So this is a pretty old project I did back in Seminole State college 5+ years ago. Its a remake of the old game Galaga! It took me a long time to make back then since I was more of a novice with programming but its fully functional and its one level you can repeat. 
It also tallys up a score for how many eneimes you shoot. You are ship shooting aliens, they are in a a group at first and slowly move down toward you, every couple of seconds some of the aliens with break formation to attack you by flying into you, you can move left and right avoid being killed.
It might be very old but im still proud of it, I also made a "sqeuel" game in way by making a java remake of Snake but I lost those files sadly.
